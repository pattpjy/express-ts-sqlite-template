# Express TypeScript Boilerplate with SQLite and Knex

This repository contains a boilerplate for an Express server with TypeScript. It utilizes SQLite as the local database and Knex as the query builder, specifically designed for the development environment.

## Features

- Express server with TypeScript for type-safe development
- SQLite for local database storage
- Knex as a query builder for easy and efficient database interactions

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using this boilerplate, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
